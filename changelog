2.0.2
- Fix maildrop writing bug. snowbox would not insert a blank line after
  each mail, making the maildrop unparsable. This bug only occured if
  a partial maildrop was written and never if all mails were deleted
  immediately by the client.
- Added systemd unit file
- Added apparmor profile (not installed by default)

2.0.1
- Support passwords with spaces. The previous argument parser would not
  allow this.
- Loglevel for failed login is now 1 (default loglevel).
- Crash in the TOP command when requesting a message number higher than
  the max number of messages. (DoS)
- Use fcntl() in addition to flock() for MTAs that do not support the later.
- Use go's ConstantTimeCompare() in the login code.

2.0
- First release of snowbox 2
