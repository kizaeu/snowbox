Source download:

To compile snowbox yourself you need a Go compiler. It has been tested
with the official release but it should also work with the gcc go
compiler.

The reference implementation is available at: http://golang.org/doc/install
It is also included in Debian Wheezy. If you can type "go" on the command
line and it produces something other than "command not found" you're good
to go.

To install:

$ make
$ sudo make install

This will install the binary in /usr/local/sbin, the config in /etc/snowbox
and a simple init script in /etc/init.d.

If you're on Debian you can use the provided init script init.d/debian for
a more "debianized" version. To add snowbox to the startup on Debian use

$ update-rc.d snowbox defaults.

After that you should edit /etc/snowbox/config to suit your needs and add
the users to /etc/snowbox/user.auth. The configuration is pretty much self
explanatory. See the manpage for more details about what can be done.


Binary distribution:

Use

$ sudo make install

These packages are the same as the source version with snowbox precompiled.
You can recompile them yourself with 'make'.


SSL:

You can create a self-signed certificate to use with snowbox with:

$ make ssl-cert

This will create a certificate valid for one year with the common name
'localhost'. You need OpenSSL installed. The command line for creating
certificates:

openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out snowbox.cert -keyout snowbox.key \
-days 365 -subj '/CN=localhost'

Change 'CN=localhost' accordingly.


Uninstalling:

$ make uninstall

This will uninstall the binary, init script and manpage. To remove the config

$ make uninstall-conf
